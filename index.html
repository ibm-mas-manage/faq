<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of moving to OpenShift?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">Some of the benefits are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:navy">Portability between cloud/on-prem environments</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Faster deployment compared to the traditional deployment model</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">More robust, resilient, high availability, and elasticity through containerization and container orchestration</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Consistency per the operator model, repeatable deployment</span> </li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Capabilities for automating and streamlining the development process</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do the operators need special configuration?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Operators do not need any special configuration - their actions are driven by the CR (Custom Resource). Operators are the backbone of the automation in OpenShift/Kubernetes.  The operator's configuration is provided by the administrator via the MAS/Manage admin UI.  Behind the scenes, this UI updates the CR (which can also be manually changed). The operators run as pods in the OCP cluster.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of the ingress controller?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Ingress controller is OpenShift/Kubernetes way of exposing the service endpoint and load balancing to your applications.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the IBM container registry (icr.io)?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
All IBM products’ images are stored there. The images are accessible if you purchased the product thus obtain an entitlement key. The entitlement key is to be provided when installing MAS, and the MAS and other application operators use this entitlement key to pull the images from icr.io.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there options for organizations that are on windows or only options to provision new RHEL envs/move to cloud?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Windows is not supported. The provided link is for setting up a development environment: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/maximo-manage/continuous-delivery?topic=administering-local-maximo-manage-development-environments">https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/maximo-manage/continuous-delivery?topic=administering-local-maximo-manage-development-environments</a>. You have the option to run it on bare metal or in VSphere. Additionally, for more information, refer to: <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/index.html#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_ocp-installation-overview">https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/index.html#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_ocp-installation-overview</a>
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there any limitations to moving to OpenShift?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:navy">Potentially more hardware is needed for smaller installations.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Short term learning curve (like any new technology).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there specific requirements for a multi-tenancy environment?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">

</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the hypervisor something IBM provides or is that open source?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
There are different hypervisor products. IBM does not provide any hypervisor.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What environment changes require application outages for users?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What authentication is needed for inbound HTTP/SOAP/REST-based integration to Manage?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
API Key authentication is required for inbound HTTP/SOAP-based integration to Manage. The API Key can be generated from the Manage administration app. The HTTP request header must include the API Key. For REST-based integration, you can use OIDC as well as an API key for authentication.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the replacement of SI bus?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">

<p><strong>How to deploy a custom Java class?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
The custom Java classes need to be packaged as a customization archive. A customization archive is a zip file and its structure is the same as the Maximo/SMP folder structure. It can include Java classes, XML, and database scripts. You need to follow the product.xml standard for customization. A customization archive is specified as part of the Manage CR spec (via the Manage deployment UI) so that the build process can include it. It can be accessed through the HTTP(s) or FTP(s) endpoint. Multiple customization archives are supported.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do we access the System.Out logs for Maximo?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Manage server logs are written to the standard output. You can view the logs from the OpenShift console. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:navy">Go to your OpenShift console, navigate to the Workload/Pods menu, Select your Manage project.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Check your Liberty server pods. Select the server pod to view log. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:navy">You can also use toolsapi to upload and retrieve logs using S3 storage.</span></p>
</li>

<td>In Manage we use PV to map with attached docs or other places where similar access <br>is needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pods</td>
<td>Pods are the smallest, most basic deployable objects in Kubernetes. A <br>pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. <br>Pods contain one or more containers, such as Docker containers. When <br>a pod runs multiple containers, the containers are managed as a single <br>entity and share the Pod's resources.</td>
<td>Deploying a Maximo "server"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RHEL<br>(RedHat Enterprise Linux)</td>
<td>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a Linux-based operating system <br>from Red Hat designed for businesses. RHEL can work on desktops, <br>on servers, in hypervisors or in the cloud. Red Hat and its community-<br>supported counterpart, Fedora,is among the most widely used Linux <br> distributions in the world.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RHCOS<br>(RedHat Core Operating System)</td>
<td>The version of RHEL that comes as part of OCP</td>
<td>If you are installing on<br> bare metal, then this is the operating system being used</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Route</td>
<td>An OpenShift route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-<br>reachable hostname like www.example.com. A defined route and the <br> endpoints identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide <br>named connectivity that allows external clients to reach your applications.</td>
<td>Replacement of IHS in EAM.  The route plus the service is used for external access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCIM<br>(System for Cross-domain Identity <br>Management)</td>
<td>A set of standardized HTTP endpoints for searching, updating, and deleting <br> user records using JSON formatted data. It also includes standards and <br>guidelines to define how user data should be formatted and sent from an <br>Identity provider to an application (and vice-versa)</td>
<td>Internally used for <br>LDAP processing between MAS and Manage via WAS Liberty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scratch Image</td>
<td>A non-runnable image that is used to build the final image.</td>
<td>Each Industry Solution, Add-On and Customization package is a scratch image that is <br>combined with the base Manage image to create the finally deployed image in MAS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Bindings</td>
<td>A way to create a Kubernetes-wide specification for communicating <br>service secrets to applications in an automated way.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Bundle/workload</td>
<td>Part of the CR/CRD definition in regards to the various Manage server types</td>
<td>Denotes type and number of Manage pods - UI, Cron, MEA, Report, All, etc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SLS<br>(Suite License Server)</td>
<td>This is the server that process AppPoints</td>
<td>AppPoints</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UBI<br>(Universal Base Image)</td>
<td>A vehicle for building and delivering certified containers and operators</td>
<td>Used as a base for creating the Manage image(s). <br>Manage uses the RedHat UBI and Liberty UBI.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Watches</td>
<td>An operator subscription to the create/change/delete event of certain OCP <br>resources. These are specifid in watches.yaml and used internally only.</td>
<td>Allows for processing new selections of deployment (for example, add a language)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workspace</td>
<td>An aggregation of namespaces used to create a MAS sub-instance. In 8.5 <br> and earlier there is always only one workspace.  In the future, within MAS <br>one could define different workspaces.</td>
<td>Similar to Namespace, but this is for MAS as a whole. Each workspace could have <br>a different configuration. This would be useful for sharing a MAS instance between <br>dev and QA environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>YAML<br>(YAML Aint Markup Language)</td>
<td>YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly <br>used for configuration files and in applications where data is being <br> stored or transmitted.</td>
<td>Used to define CRDs/CRs</td>
</tr>
