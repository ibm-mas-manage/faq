<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of moving to OpenShift?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">There are number of benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:navy">Portability between cloud/on-prem environments</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Faster deployment compared to the traditional deployment model</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">More robust, resilient, HA, and elasticity through containerization and container orchestration</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Consistency through the operator model, repeatable deployment</span> </li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Capabilities for automating and streamlining the development process</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do the operators need a special configuration?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Operators do not need any special configuration - their actions are driven by the CR (Custom Resource). Operators are the backbone of the automation in OpenShift/Kubernetes.  The operators’ configuration is provided by the administrator via the MAS/Manage admin UI.  Behind the scenes, this UI updates the CR (which can also be manually changed). The operators run as pods in the OCP cluster.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the use of the ingress controller?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Ingress controller is OpenShift/Kubernetes means of exposing the service endpoint and load balancing to your applications.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can you elaborate on IBM container registry (icr.io)?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
All IBM products’ images are stored there. The images are accessible if you purchased the product thus obtain an entitlement key. The entitlement key is to be provided when installing MAS, and the MAS and other application operators use this entitlement key to pull the images from icr.io.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there options for organizations that are on windows or only options to provision new RHEL envs/move to cloud?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Windows is not supported. You can run on bare metal or in VSphere.  See also: <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/index.html#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_ocp-installation-overview">https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/index.html#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_ocp-installation-overview</a>
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the one big limitation of moving to OpenShift?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:navy">Potentially more hardware is needed for smaller installations.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:navy">Short term learning curve (like any new technology).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there specific requirements for a multi-tenancy environment?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Multi-Tenancy is not yet supported in OpenShift.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does OpenShift allow dynamic scaling?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Yes, but MAS does not fully support it yet.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the hypervisor something IBM provides or is that open source?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
There are different hypervisor products. IBM does not provide hypervisor.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What environment changes require application outages for users?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
Any change that requires the pods to go down. This is similar to today with when you need to restart the JVM.  For example, applying a new custom archive with your customization.
</span></p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>How to deploy a custom Java class?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">
The custom Java classes need to be packaged as a customization archive. A customization archive is a zip file and its structure is the same as the Maximo/SMP folder structure. It can include Java classes, XMLs, and database scripts. You need to follow the product.xml standard for customization. A customization archive is specified as part of the Manage CR spec so that the build process can include it. It can be accessed through the HTTP(s) or FTP(s) endpoint. Multiple customization archives are supported
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do we access the System.Out logs for Maximo?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:navy">

<td>An OpenShift route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-<br>reachable hostname like www.example.com. A defined route and the <br> endpoints identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide <br>named connectivity that allows external clients to reach your applications.</td>
<td>Replacement of IHS in EAM.  The route plus the service is used for external access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCIM<br>(System for Cross-domain Identity <br>Management)</td>
<td>A set of standardized HTTP endpoints for searching, updating, and deleting <br> user records using JSON formatted data. It also includes standards and <br>guidelines to define how user data should be formatted and sent from an <br>Identity provider to an application (and vice-versa)</td>
<td>Internally used for <br>LDAP processing between MAS and Manage via WAS Liberty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scratch Image</td>
<td>A non-runnable image that is used to build the final image.</td>
<td>Each Industry Solution, Add-On and Customization package is a scratch image that is <br>combined with the base Manage image to create the finally deployed image in MAS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
