There are a number of items: Portability between cloud/on-prem environments Faster deployment compared to the traditional deployment model More robust, resilient, HA, and elasticity through containerization and container orchestration Consistency through the operator model, repeatable deployment Capabilities for automating and streamlining the development process Do the operators need a special configuration? Operators do not need any special configuration - their actions are driven by the CR (Custom Resource). Operators are the backbone of the automation in OpenShift/Kubernetes. The operators\u2019 configuration is provided by the administrator via the MAS/Manage admin UI. Behind the scenes, this UI updates the CR (which can also be manually changed). The operators run as pods in the OCP cluster. What is the use of the ingress controller? Ingress controller is OpenShift/Kubernetes means of exposing the service endpoint and load balancing to your applications. Can you please elaborate on IBM container registry (icr.io)? All IBM products\u2019 images are stored there. The images are accessible if you purchased the product thus obtain an entitlement key. The entitlement key is to be provided when installing MAS, and the MAS and other application operators use this entitlement key to pull the images from icr.io. Are there options for organizations that are on windows or only options to provision new RHEL envs/move to cloud? Windows is not supported. You can run on bare metal or in VSphere. See also: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/index.html#supported-platforms-for-openshift-clusters_ocp-installation-overview What is the one big limitation of moving to OpenShift? - Potentially more hardware is needed for smaller installations. - Short term learning curve (like any new technology. Are there specific requirements for a multi-tenancy environment? Multi Tenancy is not yet supported in OpenShift. Does OpenShift allow dynamic scaling? Yes, but MAS does not fully support it yet. Is the hypervisor something IBM provides or is that open source? There are different hypervisor products. IBM does not provide hypervisor. What environment changes require application outages for users? Any change that requires the pods to go down. This is similar to today with when you need to restart the JVM. For example, applying a new custom archive with your customization. What databases are supported?. All three databases (Db2, Db2 Warehouse, Oracle and SQL server) are supported for Manage. What Industry Solution/Add-ons are supported? All Industry Solutions/Add-ons are supported. Scheduler, Calibration, Linear are included in Manage. Life Sciences is covered via Calibration. What languages are supported? All 23 languages are supported. Are Oracle and SAP integrations supported? Yes, Oracle and SAP integrations are supported. What are the supported authentication methods in MAS? The following authentication methods are supported: Local IDP (username/password registered in Mongo DB) LDAP SAML Authentication Methods: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=configuring-authentication-methods What authentication is needed for inbound HTTP/SOAP/REST-based integration to Manage? The API Key authentication is required for inbound HTTP/SOAP-based integration to Manage. The API Key can be generated from the Manage app. The HTTP request header must include the API Key. For REST-based integration, you can use OIDC as well as an API key for authentication. What is the replacement of SI bus? Liberty JMS server, as well as Kafka community edition or any other supported JMS provider, are supported. Liberty JMS is available as a bundle from MAS config UI for any MAS Manage deployment. Is RMI supported? RMI is not supported outside of the Maximo server process. We recommend customers to leverage Maximo REST APIs instead of RMI. RMI to Rest API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY-xLlnmdI8 Is BIRT reporting supported? Yes, BIRT is supported. Your reports will be moved automatically with the database upgrade. How to restart Manage server (other than deleting pods or restarting pods)? You can start and stop Manage server using tools-api. Stop the Maximo Manage pods POST https://host:port/toolsapi/toolservice/managestop Start the Maximo Manage pods. POST https://host:port/toolsapi/toolservice/managestart Detailed Instructions: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-use-new-tools-api-maximo-application-suite How can we achieve a similar functionality as multiple JVMs (in Maximo v7.x) for different Maximo Manage entities (UI, Cron, Reporting, MIF) and segregate the functionalities accordingly? The Manage application can be deployed with different server bundles (workloads) for the processing and isolation needs. This table below shows the five different server bundles types: | Bundle Server Type | Description | | All|This bundle type contains all the code. | |UI|This bundle type contains UI code and supporting code. It is the interface for accessing Manage application.| |MEA|This bundle exposes the enterprise web services API. | |Report|This bundle contains the code that is needed to enable BIRT Report Only Server (BROS). Used to separate out the work load that is related to execution of reports that are submitted from the Manage UI. | |Cron|This bundle contains the code that is needed to run Manage cron tasks.| How to deploy a custom Java class? The custom Java classes need to be packaged as a customization archive. A customization archive is a zip file and its structure is the same as the Maximo/SMP folder structure. It can include Java classes, XMLs, and database scripts. You need to follow the product.xml standard for customization. A customization archive is specified as part of the Manage CR spec so that the build process can include it. It can be accessed through the HTTP(s) or FTP(s) endpoint. Multiple customization archives are supported How do we access the System.Out logs for Maximo? Manage server logs are written to the standard output. You can view the logs from the OpenShift console. Go to your OpenShift console, navigate to the Workload/Pods menu, Select your Manage project. Check your Liberty server pods. Select the server pod to view log. You can also use toolsapi to upload and retrieve logs using S3 storage. How can we run integrity checker? You can also use toolsapi to run integrity checker. How can we integrate Cognos with MAS? Cognos is not supported in MAS 8.8. It is in the roadmap for MAS 8.9. How is LDAP configured in MAS? MAS uses WebSphere Liberty to synchronize with LDAP. Liberty provides a SCIM API for MAS to consume the data from LDAP repositories into the MAS user registry. MAS pushes users/groups to Manage from MAS repository using user sync process. LDAP configuration: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=identity-ldap-user-registry-synchronization How is SMTP server configured? SMTP server is configured in MAS using MAS Admin UI. SMTP configuration: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=configuring-smtp-server How certificates can be applied? Cerificates can be applied from MAS Admin UI. Certificate configuration: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/maximo-manage/continuous-delivery?topic=manage-certificates What is the upgrade process? Upgrade Process: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/maximo-manage/continuous-delivery?topic=manage-upgrading-maximo-environment Are the Maximo users moved to MAS after upgrade? Yes, the Maximo users will be migrated to MAS from the existing Maximo (7612+) during the upgrade. Migrated Users: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/maximo-manage/continuous-delivery?topic=environment-managing-users-post-upgrade What are the EAM to Manage gaps? The following features/functionalities are not supported yet but are in the roadmap: Password controls/policy (password length, expiration date etc.) Disable/deactivate MAS user Bulk user load in MAS Bring your own certificate in MAS MMI does not work for multiple servers Not fully airgap enabled Bug Fixes \uf0c1 How do I apply bug fixes? Patches are periodically released with APAR fixes. It can be applied using MAS Admin UI manually or automatically if you have subscription. LA(one-off) fixes can be applied using customization archieve. What is the rollback process when a patch fails at the app layer or the db layer The rollback process include: Roll back the configuration, which is the Manage Workspace CR and its associated secrets in the OpenShift Manage namespace. The old image can be regenerated by the operator, or the old build can be specified to have the deployment point to revert back to what it was. Restore the database. (Same as 7.6) A new back-up and restore instruction document will be delivered in Manage 8.4.

We are using them to control the product matrix as part of the deployment process(eg cannot install both HSE and Oil & Gas). Ansible Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. Used for deploying pods ConfigMap Config maps hold configuration data for pods to consume. This is similar to a property file. Internally generated from CR CR (Custom Resource) A resource implemented through the Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition API. A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects. A custom resource is distinct from the built-in Kubernetes resources, such as the pod and service resources. Every CR is part of an API group. Manage CRs: * ManageApp * ManageWorkspace * ManageBuild * ManageDeployment * ManageAppStatus * ManageServerBundles * BuildDataInterpreter (for ACM) CRD (Custom Resource Definition) Create a custom resource definition to define a new custom resource. CRD is to CR as XSD is to XML. Manage CRs: * ManageApp * ManageWorkspace * ManageBuild * ManageDeployment * ManageAppStatus * ManageServerBundles * BuildDataInterpreter (for ACM) EFK (Elastic search, FluentD, Kibana) The EFK stack is a modified version of the ELK stack and is comprised of: * Elasticsearch: An object store where all logs are stored. * Fluentd: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch. * Kibana: A web UI for Elasticsearch. Once deployed in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate securely. Used for Log Analysis Entitled Registry Where IBM stores the images for download and use in MAS This is where we keep binaries that will be used to build an image. Image An image is a binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities. This is what is deployed as Manage, Monitor, Assist, etc. Kafka Apache Kafka is a framework implementation of a software bus using stream-processing. It is a pre-req for Monitor. For Manage, it is an option that can be used as a JMS queue alternative. Kubernetes aka K8s Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Maintains the \"cluster\" MAS (Maximo Application Suite) The main entry point for working with the Maximo applications (Manage, Assist, etc) Manage Formerly Maximo EAM MongoDB A NoSQL database - a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. MAS user and license metric information is stored here Namespace/Project Kubernetes provides a partitioning of the resources it manages into non-overlapping sets called namespaces In MAS, there is a namespace for Manage, a namespace for Assist, etc. In the future, there can be multiple instances of an application(eg Manage) per namespace. OCP (OpenShift Container Platform) An on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes Manages the MAS cluster OIDC (Open ID Connect) A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol Used for authentication between MAS and Manage OIDP (Open ID Provider) An identity provider, or OpenID provider (OP) is a service that specializes in registering OpenID URLs or XRIs. Used for authentication between MAS and Manage Operator Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Processing within MAS Persistent Volume A PersistentVolume (PV) is similar to drive mapping. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system. In Manage we use PV to map with attached docs or other places where similar access is needed. Pods Pods are the smallest, most basic deployable objects in Kubernetes. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods contain one or more containers, such as Docker containers. When a Pod runs multiple containers, the containers are managed as a single entity and share the Pod's resources. Deploying a Maximo \"server\" RHEL (RedHat Enterprise Linux) Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a Linux-based operating system from Red Hat designed for businesses. RHEL can work on desktops, on servers, in hypervisors or in the cloud. Red Hat and its community-supported counterpart, Fedora, are among the most widely used Linux distributions in the world. RHCOS (RedHat Core Operating System) The version of RHEL that comes as part of OCP If you are installing on bare metal, then this is the operating system being used Route An OpenShift route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-reachable hostname like www.example.com. A defined route and the endpoints identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide named connectivity that allows external clients to reach your applications. Replacement of IHS in EAM. The route plus the service is used for external access. SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) A set of standardized HTTP endpoints for searching, updating, and deleting user records using JSON formatted data. It also includes standards and guidelines to define how user data should be formatted and sent from an Identity provider to an application (and vice-versa) Internally used for LDAP processing between MAS and Manage via WAS Liberty Scratch Image A non-runnable image that is used to build the final image. Each Industry Solution, Add-On and Customization package is a scratch image that is combined with the base Manage image to create the finally deployed image in MAS Service Bindings A way to create a Kubernetes-wide specification for communicating service secrets to applications in an automated way.

Manage uses the RedHat UBI and Liberty UBI. Watches An operator subscription to the create/change/delete event of certain OCP resources. These are specifid in watches.yaml and used internally only. Allows for processing new selections of deployment (for example, add a language) Workspace An aggregation of namespaces used to create a MAS sub-instance. In 8.5 and earlier there is always only one workspace. In the future, within MAS one could define different workspaces. Similar to Namespace, but this is for MAS as a whole. Each workspace could have a different configuration. This would be useful for sharing a MAS instance between dev and QA environments.
